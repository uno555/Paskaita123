                    <p>The Honda Africa Twin is a dual-sport motorcycle. <br> In the late eighties the Adventure-Touring segment had become extremely popular in Europe. Inspired by the Paris-Dakar victories of the NXR, Honda launched the Africa Twin in 1988 and laid the foundation of what would become a legendary motorbike. <br>Honda’s first real motorcycle, the Model D (Dream) was released in 1949 and was powered by an air-cooled, 2-stroke single . Honda’s first 4-stroke motorcycle appeared only two years later – and would remain Honda’s preferred engine concept. The first twin-cylinder motorcycle to bear the Honda Emblem was the Dream C70 and featured an OHC engine with 247cc and 17,7PS.</p>

                    <h2>Long long ago</h2>
                    <p>In 1946 Honda started selling auxiliary bicycle engines in post-war Japan, where cheap transportation was desperately needed. Only two years later the Honda Motor Company was officially founded. Soichiro Honda was not only a brilliant engineer but also a true visionary, making his own dream of producing high quality motorcycles for everyone come true. </p>

                    <p>In 1984 Honda and the HRC decided to develop a motorcycle with one purpose in mind. This was to compete in the long distance overland race categories, which were growing in popularity during the 1980’s. This of course meant the Paris-Dakar. In 1986 the Honda NXR750, specifically designed for races of extreme hardship and endurance, won the Paris-Dakar. <br> The NXR750 was ahead of the competition in every way and was the first water cooled motorcycle to win this rally. Its technology then dominated the race for the following four years. </p>
